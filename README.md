# Modelling Customer Churn for a Bank
The attached notebook contains a brief EDA on an Unknown bank's data set and models customer churn using two random forest models (A basic random forest model with arbitrarily selected hyper-parameters and a tuned random forest classifier using grid search)
NOTE: Models are trained on a down sampled dataset that helps account for the imbalanced distribution of the target variables but tested on a validation set that is characterized by the original imbalanced distribution
